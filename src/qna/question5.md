question: "Use and appreciate git tools?"
---

I honestly don't know how I lived without git tools. Anytime a young developer asks me what to focus on, I tell them to make sure they have version control down, it's a game changer. You could have probably guessed this though, given all the **Github** links I've thrown out there.
