question: "Take advantage of NPM for managing your packages?"
---

Absolutely, every new project I join starts with an ```npm install```.

Recently, I've been using **yarn** more often. I'm honestly not keen on the differences between the two, I just know that *create-react-app* comes preloaded with yarn now. My old boss/mentor also leaned towards yarn, but I've had plenty of experience with both at this point.
