question: "Take pride in not just making things work, but creating beautiful code, under the hood?"

As I mentioned in response to the semantic html and code organization questions, I'm all about making sure my code is reusable. Not only is it better for other developers who may have to dive into your code down the line, but odds are you're not going to remember what you were doing yourself, and the more stream-lined and simplified you can make your process and your code, the better off you'll be.
