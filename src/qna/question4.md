question: "Meticulously organize your projects?"
---

Good organization is the key to efficiency in my eyes, so you'll see my projects are always organized. They may not follow the same organizational structure everytime, I do like to try new things, but they will definitely be organized.

This project, for instance, doesn't have much going on, but all the files are still labeled and prepared as if this were a much bigger project. Perhaps I'll want to re-use this format later and expand upon it, I don't know, and that's how I try to prepare every project.

I would recommend [checking out my projects on github](https://github.com/AnthonyPinzone) to get a better idea of how I keep them organized.
